      - During this time, I freelanced on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com) as a content writer. Saved up earnings and started my first digtial marketing agency, WiseWordsPro Digital Solutions LLP.

      - Wrote a book in July 2016: Miracle-preneuring, which is a self-help book for anyone new to the idea of entrepreneurship. I launched this book at Coffee Day HQ in BLR, via a talk (my very first) and a reading session. It sells on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Miracle-preneuring-Why-Anyone-Should-Entrepreneur/dp/153530605X), [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/miracle-preneuring/p/itmfcy3xgjphemfk), [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/miracle-preneuring-varun-choraria/1124138361), [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/miracle-preneuring/id1137891452), and [Google Books](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Miracle_Preneuring.html?id=KuTyvQAACAAJ&redir_esc=y). I even wrote a [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3q1CGiPXNhDUEwwZUZpR3hZYVU/view?usp=sharing) on it and have done giveaways on LinkedIn for 3 years on the book's anniversary, sharing 3000+ copies. I also made [3 cringy promo videos to market it](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW4BHOGauqa0cXLJ278brkg). At the time it was a proud achievement to make these videos by myself using [Biteable.](https://biteable.com)

      - Published [5 review papers,](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SbIbQTv75_cyxSsPH_VFCYDLuUhViS3G?usp=sharing) national-level.

      - Grew WiseWordsPro to a Privite Limited, and rebranded it as WiseWords Interactive Studio Private Limited. The object of doing this was solely to do business with global enterprises, and become a premium brand in the market.

      - Featured in [Entrepreneur Magazine](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315272) for being a LinkedIn influencer between 2016-2018. I deleted my old account in 2020 and quit the platform. Now I just have an account for formality sakes. I don't check it or bother with it (FYI).

      - In 2019 I built my first no-code side project [Aibo](https://getaibo.launchaco.com). I built this because I couldn't afford an MBA and hence thought of building a conversational bot with curated resources that anyone could access on any device and on any internet bandwidth, without compromise in functionality or design. It trended on [#4 on Product Hunt.](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/aibo-2)

      - Final year engineering project on composites was funded by the Govt. of Karnataka. You can view my [project thesis here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PzRhHtNXOgFnOxLP09lzuSPJr0YXsmT4/view?usp=sharing)

These days, I'm spending all my time learning how to code, design, and pick up hard skills around GTM and sales at work. I'm also engaged with body-building and cycling.
