During the course of January 2021 I already started losing sight of my goals and the steam of my motivation engine. Before I knew it consistency fell off the wagon too. I decided to spend some time rethinking my approach to achieving goals, and this article is one such attempt to dissect the same.

The meat of the thesis posted here have been inspired from these articles:

1. [How to deploy yourself in the world](https://medium.com/absolute-zero/how-to-deploy-yourself-in-the-world-c3ca6b57d678)

Last year, I used the method of [OKRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJB83EZtAjc) to structure all that I wanted to achieve in the pandemic year of 2020. To some extent I was successful- I completed some of my OKRs and unexpectedly added one and hit that goal too (cycling 1,000 kms). I’ve written about it extensively [in this post](https://vc97.medium.com/a-sorcerers-guide-to-co-relating-activities-to-drive-desired-outcomes-791367ba160e) if you’d like to check out.

But the thing with achieving goals soon enough is that you begin to think you’re invincible, when in fact you’ve barely just begun. People are right when they say goals must be thought with the larger cap of life in mind. But I’m not a very imaginative person, as I’ve come to realize, and so it’s important for me to focus on step-function improvements vs. attempting giant leaps.

After a lot of thinking and reading, I’ve come to learn that goal achievement is a function of taking simplified, disciplined decisions over time. Parallelly, finding your economic engine as a subset of this process is equally important.

Let’s get down to basics. Pareto-ing your life begins at the root of finding what you are naturally encoded for. It’s different from what you’re skilled or good at- because that’s something you acquire, but aren’t born with.

In edge cases there may not be much difference between the two, but consider yourself average regressed to the mean (=tending towards mediocre). An interesting mental model to note is to start collecting data on yourself. It’s the simplest fashion to start becoming witness to your own growth.

You can observe yourself scientifically by taking [weeknotes like james chudley](https://james-chudley.medium.com/weeknotes-week-2-25-30-jan-f1788e64d3c6) (which I am commencing this week myself). It’s a simple retrospective template that you can fill out over the course of a week and just read through on a Sunday evening.

If journaling comes naturally to you, I’d recommend that. Do this with the tools and process of your choice, but with the ultimate [JTBD](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca) of self-observation and accountability.

By extension, I first used loop habit tracker on my older android phone to observe my growth via the consistency in habits. I found the need to upgrade that personal accountability system because I’ve started aspiring bigger and more holistically ([you can read about it here](https://vc97.medium.com/solving-the-quarter-life-identity-crisis-e9b3e05027ff)), and hence needed to think more mindfully about what I say yes and no to.

I found the idea of a [Jeolgi](https://medium.com/better-humans/a-complete-guide-to-reorganizing-your-year-into-24-jeolgi-challenges-9998a5f55c59) to be very practical. In the product management world these are sprints, but let’s stick to Joelgi. The core tenets of this is:

1. Novelty, or excitement:
2. Managing expectations
3. Increasing self-control

They sound highly aspirational, but let’s try and understand it by breaking the elements.

But first, why the Jeolgi or sprint?

*“When you have a year in front of you, skipping one day doesn’t seem like a lot. After all, it’s only 0.27% of it. If you skip one day when you only have two weeks, you’re missing 7%. It matters a lot more so it’s easier to remain controlled and work on whatever challenge you’ve given yourself.”- [quote from the article.](https://medium.com/better-humans/a-complete-guide-to-reorganizing-your-year-into-24-jeolgi-challenges-9998a5f55c59)*

These periods last for about a fortnight, but I think that period is flexible depending on your project. You can do a sprint for a week to a fortnight to three weeks too. The reason I’ve decided to prioritize this is because of ‘present bias’- a tendency where we give more importance to immediate payoffs keeping in perspective trade-offs between two future moments.

I believe this might work better than my older system because of the novelty or excitement factor. As a person I’m an inherent thrill-seeker, and I tend to work best under pressure. To my case scenario, setting a limit of 2 weeks to achieve a few short goals might keep my will power levels stable.

*“It’s much easier to evaluate something two weeks from now because the variables are fewer. You know you won’t grow tenfold your vocabulary in a new language. You know you won’t be able to run a marathon. But you do know you could learn 100 words or run a total of ten kilometers in the next two weeks.”- [quote from the article.](https://medium.com/better-humans/a-complete-guide-to-reorganizing-your-year-into-24-jeolgi-challenges-9998a5f55c59)*

How do you plan this sprint?

This bit is also a good leeway to the next aspect of the article, so follow on.

I’d suggest to start using Tim Ferris’ DiSSS technique, as mentioned in the article. It’s a powerful set of clarifying questions.

- Deconstruction: “*What are the minimal learning units I should start with?*”
- Selection: “*Which 20% of the units should I focus on for 80% or more of the outcome I want?*
- Sequencing: *“In what order should I learn the units?”*
- Stakes: “*How do I set up stakes to create real consequences and guarantee I follow the program?”*

Common pitfalls of a jeolgi- summary from the article:

| **Theme** | **Description** |
| :----: | :-----|
| --------| ----|
| Under Expecting | Two weeks seems like an extremely short amount of time so it’s easy to think you can’t accomplish anything of consequence. It’s not. Two weeks is enough to improve a lot. Make it a challenge, not a simple task you can do in half the time.|
| Not assessing your available time | When you decide to try a Jeolgi challenge, take a moment to assess how much time you can dedicate to it. Some Jeolgi challenges will need more time. Plan them for when you have some.|
| Doing the wrong challenge | Make sure each of your Jeolgi challenges are what you want to focus on right now. |
| Over prepping | Meta-learning is a crucial aspect of Jeolgi challenges but be careful not to overdo it. |
|Beware of Jeolgi challenges on your passion| When you’re trying a Jeolgi challenge for something you’ve done for years, you mess with the flow you had developed. When you finish a Jeolgi challenge on your passion, you’ll feel lost. You’ll wonder what you should do next that could help you improve without doing another real challenge. Jeolgi challenges are like a shot of improvement. They change your rhythm as you try something new or dig further into something else. They are supposed to be “extras”. You want them to improve your life.|


The next question is, how do we maximize our learning cycles?

The only litmus test to anything is the impact of outcomes. No one cares about a self-victimising tweet or a LinkedIn post. World runs on money, not emotions. Additionally, in a world that is billions of years old, and most things have already been figured out, I would like to capitalise on the works of my forefathers and conduct learning sessions more smartly. You shouldn't bother reinventing the wheel at all. In a dog-eat-dog world scenario, velocity matters.

Some principles, [from the article](https://medium.com/better-humans/ultralearning-how-i-became-a-top-20-chess-player-in-under-50-hours-4e085a3b8a4b):

#### **Optimize your plan** to exclusively focus on high-impact activities:

- Spend 10% time on research and planning

- *“When practice is peppered with questions like “is this the best use of my time?,” “how does this relate?,” and “is this even relevant?,” we waste attentional resources as focus shifts from actual improvement to understanding our cognition. Developing a practice plan removes this [metacognitive burden](https://andymatuschak.org/books/), preserving practice time solely for learning the craft.*
*Because we’re trying to optimize the amount of learning in a given timeframe, we must be selective with our attention, focusing only on the highest value activities. To limit the scope, Tim Ferris uses the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) (the 80/20 rule) that says 80% of the results come from 20% of the work. To further optimize this selection, we focus on sequencing skill acquisition.”- [quote from the article.](https://medium.com/better-humans/ultralearning-how-i-became-a-top-20-chess-player-in-under-50-hours-4e085a3b8a4b)*

- In addition to this, I’ve come to realize that the best way to learn a skill is actually by doing it, and then getting better at it over time. If you want to become good at product design, start prototyping and designing user journeys vs. just reading about it 24x7. Maintain a balance between studying theory and practising it.

#### **Practice with intention** to maximize your training outcomes:

- High intensity training and compartmentalized practise times everyday is the core of this point. Pre-plan daily goals that you want to achieve, block time on your calendar and execute it. Remove distractions, and make it easier for yourself to just start.

- If you are trying to understand how to manage time effectively, [this is the best article on it.](https://blog.usejournal.com/calendar-in-stead-of-to-do-lists-9ada86a512dd)


#### **Drill on deconstructed** skills to internalize learning:

- *“Learning comes from improving weak areas. To find weak areas, we need to seek out the harshest feedback. Without a teacher, Ericsson recommends the three Fs: “Focus. Feedback. Fix it.” Putting ourselves in situations where we can fail lets us honestly dissect the shortcomings of our performance. While incredibly uncomfortable, this process of investing in loss brought me the greatest dividends.”- [quote from the article.](https://medium.com/better-humans/ultralearning-how-i-became-a-top-20-chess-player-in-under-50-hours-4e085a3b8a4b)”*

#### **Ruthlessly target your weaknesses** to overcome your barriers.

- Enlist your weak points. They are your goals and path to victory. Prioritize them and work over each, like a checklist. Voila.

### Edit: 16th Feb 2021:
Paras Chopra put out [this tweet](https://twitter.com/paraschopra/status/1361350824262213639) which serves as a good conclusion:

"Thinking deeply to figure out your life’s purpose is doing it wrong because you pretty soon realise that logic is inert - it can’t tell you what to do with your life. Instead, start with an emotionally-felt purpose and then think deeply about how to make progress towards it."

Point is, everything mentioned in this post should help you figure out one of the two things:

1. The two week sprint is just enough time to gauge if you're really interested in something or not.

2. The two week sprint is just enough time to gauge if you can nail consistency, get out of inertia of rest and scale.
