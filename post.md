In this section of the website, I largely share frameworks either from deep study or lived experience. Nothing entirely speculative. I also make the effort of open sourcing bookmarks and playbooks, that you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/varun-choraria). If anything you find here is of value, simply pay it forward by either applying them yourself or sharing it with someone.

Do note that this website does not use any trackers or analytics. I frankly don't care who you are or what you do. If you want to connect, you can on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/miraclepreneur)
