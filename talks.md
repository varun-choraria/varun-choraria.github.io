I enjoy interacting with audiences of all size and communities. I largely do it for the pleasure of exchanging stories and networking. Normally, I don't charge a fee but if it's a physical event- my only constraint is that travel and accommodation need to be looked after.

Topics I speak on: Products, Startups, Writing, and the occasional motivational speaking.

You can view some of the talks that I've given below:

### Miracle-preneuring book launch

**August 2016, Cafe Coffee Day HQ, BLR**

This was my first talk ever with the employees of CCD. The best accompaniment to a good cup of french roast is either a loved one or a book. Hence, at the time it seemed fit to launch my first book with one of India's largest coffee chains. Unfortunately, I don't have a recording of this talk, but CCD team were kind enough to put out [this tweet.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qm8rfr1jKw5oQpQS9)

### Chromozome- Digital Marketing Lead Generation Conference

**August 2019, Courtyard by Mariott, BLR**

Second talk on 'Growth Hacking Product Marketing'. In this talk, I ran through how I built, growth-hacked to 900 users and became the trending product of the day on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com) for my side-project [AiboMBA.](https://getaibo.launchaco.com) Here's a [list of the other speakers](https://photos.app.goo.gl/MAeaxzLX3iEngbhZ9) (aware that it's a bad photo).

### General Talk (Webinar)

**May 2020, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell, Bangalore Institute of Technology**

My first talk with their esteemed institution. I ran through how I started up in college, wrote a book, and built a viral side-project. In addition, I also showed the students some of my note-taking and productivity methods (mental models) that I apply to learn and upskill myself.
