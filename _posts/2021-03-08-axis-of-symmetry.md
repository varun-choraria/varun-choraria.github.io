I think growing up our social conditioning is rigged in such a condescending way that our internal scale of success never tend to leave us. The subconscious mind will have created such firm mental representations that our distorted realties will seem to us as the whole truth.

Over time, I've seen my own perceptions of success involve a lot. By degree, I am a mechanical engineer but by training, I'm a marketer. In college, I used to think owing a business was the ultimate goal in life, and I started a few businesses that helped me recover my college fees- but after a point I hit the ceiling with how much I could really do in terms of learning, which is around the time I decided to quit.

To give products a try, I built [AiboMBA,](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/aibo-2) a no-code tool that teaches you the basics of MBA via conversations on Facebook Messenger. While that didn't work out so well, it introduced me to the world of SaaS- and fast-forward today where I work with a series-B startup, close to two years now. My perception of skill, luck and success has evolved quite a bit:

Success- rate of outcomes vs. rate of perceived efforts. Reach a point in life where 80-20 becomes the norm in all wealth and status creation activities.

Luck- increasing the surface area of serendipity- there are too many variables in life to control at any point, so it's more pragmatic to optimise for being at the right place at the right time- which can be distilled to something actionable like increasing number of new people you meet, using more social media to get visibility, so forth. (tl;dr- increasing 'discoverability' odds).

Skill- when small differences in actions are able to produce large differences in outcomes. This is a subset of success (and my definition of it too).

## Getting comfortable with Multi-dimensionality

Tim Urban [tweeted this the other day](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1367871165319049221?s=20) and it's a profound graph that can also be studied to understand just how uncomfortable we humans get when we are presented with multiple choices.

Every instant in life offers multiple possibilities, like multiple endings to an adventure game or a novel. When we're faced with such choices to make, it's hard to determine which could be the best course of action.

[In an earlier post,](https://vc97.medium.com/how-to-bet-on-yourself-in-2021-and-become-pandemic-proof-2a31d888b79a) I shared the concept of a simple scenario planning based on your current belief system- which is essentially using your own gut to drive decision making. The biggest upside to this is that the decision- making model is inherently contextual, which makes it a foolproof method to follow.

But an interesting mental model to note is that happiness, luck, skill, smartness, etc- are individual axis of symmetries. Reason being they're are so serendipitously complex that correlation is just gross oversimplification. Any and all work- be it trying to be happy, trying to become smarter, trying to start a business- require the same amount of intellectual labor.

Thus, it makes sense to measure the legitimacy of one's life and career with a custom yardstick, a rule built for you.

But this fact is more platitude than fact, so is there a possibility that sheep-like behaviour might just be the better way out?

## Sheep

It's very hard to come across original thinking these days solely because we're consuming content at alarming levels, to the extent that it's clouding our judgements. When we're thinking, I'm sure a lot of us find ourselves always saying 'person P said this, so we should do this because they're more experienced or it's just the norm'.

In some cases it's good to refer to advice to extract playbacks out of them, but sound minds will agree the most effective results come when it's just you figuring everything out by yourself (aka building the parachute after you've jumped off the cliff).

Mostly, advice and action of most kinds follow pattern-matching manifestations like I mentioned before- that the moment we're faced with a lot of possibilities, our first instinct is to bucket them. [In another recent article](https://varunchoraria.com/rate-of-survival/) that I'd written on survivorship bias, I'd pointed out a mental model on how we naturally tend to ignore negative data- bad results from basically doing the best possible things (but we shouldn't, because they are our maximum points of vulnerabilities).

But the picture overall is not so grim. While choosing one-dimensional career trajectories, or choosing a singular path to happiness, or when building a startup- it's good to place your bet on your one core strength and go 100x on that.

As an individual, that could be your writing and designing skills (creative), or as a developer it could be that you write the most simplest lines of code, or as a startup you're just the absolute best at onboarding your customers- because once this compounds, it becomes your biggest moat.

Conformist sheep tend to regress to the mean, and in cases of both individual and startups it's usually failure or being average. By natural law you'll be a few percentage points better than the previous generation, but use the omnipresent conformity to your advantage- as mentioned before- along one of the three yardsticks- career, happiness, luck- to create exceptional outcomes.
