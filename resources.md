## Bookmarks

Access this [notion page](https://www.notion.so/01832c649ea046039aeb724aaa36eec8?v=382df55558ca44289af0b43bbd32dede). I bookmark articles, podcast notes, etc. here on the topics that I'm curious about. This is a dynamic database- meaning you will see real-time edits as I'm working on it myself. Use the drop-down menu to toggle between themes.

## Bookshelf

You can view my bookshelf on [GoodReads here.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112173049-varun-choraria) I maintain this account actively. Alternatively, I also maintain my [personal bookshelf on notion here.](https://www.notion.so/Books-f3693ee011ef492eb5fad84c77f15ea7) No difference between this and my goodreads account, other than the book notes which I'm working on. Use the drop-down menu to toggle between themes.

## Playbooks

I use these notion documents in my day-to-day. They have been inspired from people I follow and general internet surfing. Again, these are dynamic documents- you will probably witness live editing as I work on them myself.
